## Motivation

This app can be used as a supplementary app to the [OlymPulse app](https://tetrahydrofuran.shinyapps.io/olympulse/). The OlymPulse app aims to look at the performance of nations over the course of the olympics based on specific sports,  year of competition and the olympic season (winter/summer). This app on the other hand focuses on looking at the performance of the nations based on demographic factors like age, height, weight and sex. As such, this app can be used in conjuction with the OlymPulse to see what demographic factors help in getting more medals as well as how much of a disparity is there in the performance of male and female athletes in different sports.
